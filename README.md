Problem Statement (20 points)
We have decided to make a PC version graphical calculator because most of the graphical calculators available on website need internet access. Additionally, graphical calculator helps science students identify the trend and growth rate of the function more intuitively. Our graphical calculator is capable of drawing the diagram of a user-input elementary function or finite piecewise elementary functions. It should allow the user to compare the diagram of multiple functions on a single graph, rescale the axis and identify the discontinuities.

Objectives (40 points)
Draw a (pixel) diagram of the input elementary or piecewise elementary function.
Rescale the edges using euclid/log metrics.
Draw multiple functions in a single graph and identify them based on colors/other characteristics.
Detect discontinuities.
Graphical user interface.
Display the corresponding point on the diagram when given an x value.
Save the diagram to the local machine.

Stakeholders (10 points)
Users: People who want to convert the elementary function or finite piecewise elementary functions to intuitive graph.

Deliverables (30 points)
A comprehensive desktop based graphing calculator with the following deliverables: 
Use Java for the project.
Use IntelliJ as the IDE.
Use JPanel.canvas for diagram generation.
Use pixel diagram to represent the function diagram.
